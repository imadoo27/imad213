## 📌 About the Tool

**imad213** is an advanced backend-focused automation engine built to explore how Instagram's behind-the-scenes infrastructure can be tested, simulated, and understood from a technical perspective.

It is **not a follower-increaser or front-end spammer**. Instead, it was designed to:

- Understand backend logic through automation
- Simulate requests and user flows
- Interact with APIs and hidden endpoints
- Test vulnerability points in ethical contexts

---

## ⏳ Project Status: Temporarily Suspended

This project is currently **unreleased** due to multiple factors:

- Potential misuse by unauthorized users
- Security concerns and ethical limitations
- Platform policies (such as PyPI restrictions)
- Ongoing internal development and refactoring

---

## 🌐 Will it Be Released?

That is unknown.

While the project has **clear potential and a future in automation/security research**, its public release **may never happen** — or could happen at an unexpected time.

If you're interested in serious backend-level tools and automation focused on platforms like Instagram, this is a project worth watching.
