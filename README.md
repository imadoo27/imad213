# 🛠️ imad213 – Python Automation Tool (Archived)

> This project has been officially discontinued and removed from PyPI for various operational and ethical reasons. It is no longer maintained or supported.

## 📌 About the Project

**imad213** was developed as a Python-based automation tool originally intended for educational and testing purposes in environments such as:

- Instagram interaction automation
- Telegram bot integration
- Frontend + backend HTML manipulation
- Web UI testing and response logging

The tool was designed to demonstrate how automation and API interaction can work together across multiple platforms, especially in ethical hacking labs and penetration testing simulations.

## ❗ Project Status: Archived

Due to a combination of the following reasons, I’ve chosen to officially archive and remove the tool from public repositories:

- Misuse by unauthorized individuals in unintended ways  
- Concerns raised by open-source communities about user safety  
- Ethical and security implications related to how the tool could be exploited  
- PyPI’s internal policies on user interaction and credential collection

---

## 🤝 Why I Removed It

While the tool had legitimate use cases in testing environments, I understand that public availability can sometimes lead to abuse.

Rather than allow that, I made the decision to remove the package entirely and stop any further development.
